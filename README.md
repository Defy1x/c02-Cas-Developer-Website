# Project:
## Title:
# c02-Cas-Developer-Website

## Description:
As for our second week of homework for this assignment we (Columbia Engineering Bootcamp students) were given the following user story below and acceptance criteria:

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

The key focus on the project was taking all the material we have learned over the past three weeks and creating a beautiful portfolio site of our choosing. This process involved writing html and css from scratch. I (Casandra McDonald) first started by creating a git repo and setting up my local folder structure. I drew a wireframe and then wrote all of the HTML. Then I started styling with CSS. After, I moved into Flexbox and additional styling features. I added a few fun things that were not taught in class such as horizontal rules, adding a fav icon, and the font awesome library. Additionally I used subtle transform hover properties. I used materialize.css to create a form and finally media queries to capture smaller screens. Lastly I structured and cleaned up all my thml and css. The end result was a clean, beautiful portfolio site. Even though It took a while because of my perfectionism, I am very happy with my work.

Thanks for reading!
